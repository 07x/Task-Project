1 - Creating a Django  Project & Setup 
2 - Project & App Setup 
3 - Custome User Setup  
    (i)  Create a manager for this customer model  
        - One thing we have to consider while creating a manager is that 
          for both case  we only have to select BaseUserManager
    (ii) Create a model based on that manager
       - While creating a customer model we must select  a AbstractUser 
         because this will provide additional feature so we can add fields without changing from scratch 

4 - Update On Settings File as Well 
    AUTH_USER_MODEL = "users.CustomUser"

5 - python manage.py makemigrations 
  - python manage.py migrate
